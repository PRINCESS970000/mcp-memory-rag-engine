"""
Self-Refine for the Adaptive Learning Path Planning agent.

Sub-task this is routed to: generating the human-readable explanation the
student sees, justifying the recommended path (which courses, why, total
cost, timeline). This is cheap to redo -- a single short paragraph -- which
is exactly the kind of output Self-Refine fits (one draft, one critique
against an explicit rubric, one revision). It is NOT used for the path
search itself (that's LATS's job) or for full re-attempts across trials
(that's Reflexion's job, in reflexion.py).

Adapted from the toolkit's algorithms/self_refine.py:
- Same overall shape: deterministic_checks() feed a grounded_report into
  the critique prompt, then a revision step.
- Swapped the LLM client: the toolkit uses LangChain's BaseChatModel
  (ChatMistralAI). This project already calls the Anthropic SDK directly
  elsewhere (see rag/generate.py), so this file matches that pattern
  instead of introducing LangChain as a second LLM-calling convention.

Grounded vs. ungrounded, explicitly:
- UNGROUNDED: the critique_response call below asks the model to judge its
  own draft against a rubric. It can catch vague or incomplete writing, but
  it cannot catch a *factual* error confidently stated in fluent prose --
  a wrong total price or a course that isn't actually in the path reads
  just as "correct-sounding" to the same model that wrote it.
- GROUNDED: grounded_path_checks() below never calls an LLM. It checks the
  draft's claims against the same real data environment.py validates paths
  against (course titles, prices) -- deterministic string/number matching,
  not opinion.
See planning_eval/ for the documented case where grounded_path_checks()
caught a wrong total-cost claim that the ungrounded critique alone missed.
